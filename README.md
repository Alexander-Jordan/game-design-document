# Game Design Document

A template that can be used to create a [Game Design Document](/game-design-document/gdd.md) for your game.

It also includes an [Art Bible](/art-bible/art-bible.md), a [Audio Design Document](/audio-design-document/add.md), and a [Level Design Document](/level-design-document/ldd.md).

Feel free to use and customize one, some, or all of them to plan out the design of your game.
